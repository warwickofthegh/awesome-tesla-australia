- Windscreen & Glass: Preferrable, no 3rd party suppliers of glass currently, and Tesla Charge $1000+ for replacement
- Hire Car: Preferrable, Tesla repair can be significantly delayed due to parts availability, hire care may be need during wait if not safe to drive

### Windscreen Washer Fluid
- Tesla recommend not using any product promoted a bug cleaner as it may streak and cause noise

### Delivery Checklist

- More commonly used before quality improvements were made, especially in Giga Shanghai models
- Tesla will say accept delivery of car and you'll have 7 days to log any issues via a service appointment, though it may be possible for them to argue external defects were caused in that 7 day period, so always best to do a quick once over before accepting, or log on the day before leaving at least
